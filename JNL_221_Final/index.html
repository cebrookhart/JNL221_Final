  	<H1>Empty Homes, Full Shelters: Syracuse's Housing Dilemma</H1>

  	<H4><EM>By Camryn Brookhart</EM></H4>

    <p>As a city with both numerous vacant properties and a large homeless population, Syracuse faces a challenge unlike any other: There are numerous neighborhoods that have more vacant properties than others, and many ever-filling homeless shelters. As the homeless populations begins to rise in Syracuse, there are struggles faced not only by those who have lost their homes, but also by shelters as they face an extreme influx of such people. So, this raises the question: Can these abandoned residential homes be repurposed and used to accommodate Syracuse’s homeless population?</p>

    <iframe title="Vacant Residential Properties by Neighborhood in Syracuse" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-DGHzm" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DGHzm/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 60%; height: 200px; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="901" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>

  	<p>According to the above graphic, there are more vacant properties in some areas of the city than in others. This is particularly obvious in neighborhoods such as Brighton, in which there are a bounding 211 vacant residential properties. As can be seen, numerous other neighborhoods also have high numbers of these vacant properties, creating missed opportunities for the homeless across Syracuse.</p>

    <p>So, what does this mean? This stark imbalance in the number of vacant properties from neighborhood to neighborhood in Syracuse highlights numerous challenges for the city and for individuals, such as refurbishing abandoned homes and bureaucratic hurdles</p>

    <p>Syracuse, like so many other cities, has faced a complex array of challenges through its history.  Redlining, which is the discriminatory practice of limiting financial service to people who live in certain neighborhoods, is most often as a result of their race or ethnicity. This has proven to be a major issue in Syracuse, especially through the construction and the deconstruction of the i-81 highway which runs right through the center of the city. What role does red lining play in this issue? Well, it all has to do with WHERE the vacant properties happen to be in the city and who lives in those specific areas.</p>

    <p>The footprint that redlining left remains visible in Syracuse, and can be seen particularly in neighborhoods that have been affected by the construction, and now leveling of the I-81 highway. These areas are home, due to redlining, primarily to marginalized communities, and are often burdened with the brunt of housing instability and neglect. </p>

    <p>Rescue Mission is an organization that exists in Syracuse, Auburn, and Binghamton, New York. Their mission is to offer food, shelter, and clothing to those who need it in surrounding areas. They offer not only temporary emergency housing, but permanent housing, as well, catering to the needs of each individual. Yulon Jones, the Chief Spiritual Life Officer at Rescue Mission, is dedicated to making the lives of those facing these troubles as easy as possible. He emphasized the organization’s dedication not only to aiding people in need with their practical ailments, but also to offer spiritual and emotional care to those who seek their aid. </p>

    <p>“Whatever someone believes”, Jones says “I give them guidance if they choose to learn more. I’m someone they can lean on and talk to, with the promise that nothing they share will be revealed unless it puts themselves or others in danger. Sometimes I’m a big brother, sometimes I’m a father. But most of all, I’m there to make sure they have some sense of normalcy”.</p>

    <p>Jones highlights that many of these people’s lives have been turned upside down, and sometimes all they need is a little guidance to navigate this new world which they’ve entered.</p>

    <p>It is no secret that homelessness is prominent in Syracuse. This is why it has become increasingly common to see things like anti-homeless architecture. This kind of architecture can present as bolts on the steps of a building so that a human can not lay down on them, or as benches that are just short enough for someone to sit on, but quite impossible for someone to be able to lay down. Architecture such as this also creates an influx of people seeking shelter with organizations like Rescue Mission, or more commonly known initiatives like the Salvation Army. </p>

    <p>Jones continued to note a profound stigma surrounding homelessness. “They’re shunned everywhere they go and reminded how they look like they don’t belong,” he said. “At Rescue Mission, we make it a point to create normalcy. I’ve organized things like movie nights, trips to the park, bowling, fishing, and even personal one-on-one outings for coffee or lunch. It’s all about making them feel human and valued.”</p>

    <p>The reality is that there are still 1,800 properties across Syracuse, waiting to be inhabited by these people. Transforming even a fraction of them to aid them in getting back on their feet could prove to make a world of difference, and could drastically reduce the pressure on shelters such as Rescue Mission. These properties are not just empty buildings, but pillars for a future where housing insecurity in Syracuse can be significantly reduced.</p>
